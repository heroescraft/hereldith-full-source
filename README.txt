Hereldith

Everything's cool except that it uses os.system('clear') to clear screen, and
keyboard.press_and_release('f11') to enter full screen....


On with the game:
	Hereldith currently doesn't have much player help with the "controls". That is
	the second perpose of this file. First of all, if you ever want to quit quickly
	just use to keybind: CTRL+c. (NOTE: If you have text highlighted it will instead
	of quitting, copy the highlighted text to your clipboard.)

	Main Menu:
		new: Creates a new character.
		load: Loads a current character, if you don't have any it will bring you
	back to main menu.
		quit: quits the program
	In Game:
		travel <place>: Travels to the specified town. Note: you may only go
	to towns that have a road leading to them. In the GUI there is a list of
	roads you may travel on. Also just "travel" works as a command.
		use <item>: Uses the specified item.
		shop <shop>: Goes to the specified shop. The list of shops in your current
	location will tell you
		quit: quits the program.
